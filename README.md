# About Me

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Deepak, and I'd like to share a bit about myself and the dynamic school list project I've been working on.

## Project Overview

### HTML Structure

I've created a simple HTML structure with a focus on showcasing a list of schools dynamically. The main components include:

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file with basic metadata, including a title and links to external stylesheets and scripts.

### Styling

I've applied some basic styling to enhance the visual appeal. The key styles include:

- **Body**: Black background color for the body.
- **Heading (h1)**: Centered, bold, white font with a cursive style.
- **Container**: Positioned container for the school list with specific styling for `ul` and `li` elements.
- **Button**: A styled button with a fixed position, designed for triggering the dynamic school list.

### JavaScript Logic

The dynamic school list is populated using JavaScript. Here's a brief overview:

- **`app.js`**: JavaScript file responsible for making an AJAX call to retrieve school data from a JSON file (`urlData.json`) and dynamically generating school list elements.

### School Data

I've included a sample JSON file (`urlData.json`) with an array of school objects, each containing information such as school name, board, city, location, and an image URL.

## Running the Project

To see the dynamic school list in action, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click the "Tap to school list" button to trigger the dynamic school list generation.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery (for AJAX calls)

Feel free to explore the project and make any modifications or improvements as needed. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
